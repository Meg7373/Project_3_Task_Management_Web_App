# Project 3 Task Management Web App

### Overview of the Project

The overview of the project is to create a task management application that will manage a 'to-do' list utilizing React. The application requires that two views be hosted: /todos and /contact. The following are required on the 'todos' page of the application: a task list, a form with a text input box and submit button that allows the user to add a task, mark items 'complete', remove a task, offers a way to view all, completed, or incomplete tasks, and always reflect the status of each task as such. The following are required on the 'contact' page of the application: a contact form containing a first name field, last name field, email field, comments field, and when the form is submitted, a change in the page reflects that. Additional requirements include 10+ custom CSS rules, horizontal navigation bar, 1+ example of content side-by-side, user stories, wireframes collection, state tree, container and presentational components of planning phase, a Readme.md file, functionality description, technologies used, ideas for future improvement, and 15+ commits to the GitHub respository.
