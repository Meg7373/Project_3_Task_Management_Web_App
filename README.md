# Project 3 Task Management Web App

### Overview of the Project

The overview of the project is to create a task management application that will manage a 'to-do' list utilizing React. The application requires that two views be hosted: /todos and /contact. The following are required on the 'todos' page of the application: a task list, a form with a text input box and submit button that allows the user to add a task, mark items 'complete', remove a task, offers a way to view all, completed, or incomplete tasks, and always reflect the status of each task as such. The following are required on the 'contact' page of the application: a contact form containing a first name field, last name field, email field, comments field, and when the form is submitted, a change in the page reflects that. Additional requirements include 10+ custom CSS rules, horizontal navigation bar, 1+ example of content side-by-side, user stories, wireframes collection, state tree, container and presentational components of planning phase, a Readme.md file, functionality description, technologies used, ideas for future improvement, and 15+ commits to the GitHub respository.


### Functionality of the Application

The website application offers a navigation bar that allows the user to switch between the To-Do List page and the contact form page. On the To-Do List page, a to-do feature is in the center. There is a text box and an 'add' button that allows a task to be added. Underneath, is a list of the given tasks the user wants to add. Along side each task, is the 'delete' and 'complete' button. On the Contact Form page, there is a full name box for the user to type their name, an email box, comments box, and a 'submit' button.

### Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Add emojis for user interaction when creating a to-do list.
2. Create the ability for the user to create multiple to-do lists simultaneously.
3. Add the ability on the contact form for the to-do list to be sent directly to the user's email.
